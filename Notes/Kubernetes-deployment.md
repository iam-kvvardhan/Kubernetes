**📌 Kubernetes: Pods, Deployments & ReplicaSets**

**🔹 Pods**

- A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- It can run one or multiple containers together.

- Containers in a Pod share:

    - Networking (same IP address, localhost communication).
    - Storage (shared volumes).

- Limitations of Pods:

No auto-healing → if a pod fails, it won’t restart automatically.

No auto-scaling → cannot handle varying workloads automatically.

🔹 Deployments

A Deployment is a higher-level Kubernetes resource used to manage Pods.

Features:

Auto-healing → if a pod crashes, it is automatically recreated.

Auto-scaling (with HPA – Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).

Ensures the desired number of replicas are always running.

Best practice: Always use Deployments instead of creating Pods directly.

Deployments create and manage ReplicaSets in the background.

🔹 ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes controller that ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running.

Responsibilities:

Maintain the desired state → if a pod is deleted, a new one is created.

Implement auto-healing by recreating missing pods.

A Deployment automatically creates a ReplicaSet, which in turn manages Pods.

🔹 How They Work Together

You create a Deployment (e.g., for an Nginx app).

The Deployment creates a ReplicaSet.

The ReplicaSet ensures the desired number of Pods are running.

If a Pod is deleted → ReplicaSet recreates it.

If you scale replicas up or down in the Deployment → ReplicaSet adjusts Pods accordingly.

🔹 Practical Example

Define a Deployment YAML with 3 replicas of Nginx.

Kubernetes will:

Create a ReplicaSet.

ReplicaSet ensures 3 Pods are always running.

If one Pod crashes → ReplicaSet replaces it.

If replicas are increased to 5 → ReplicaSet creates 2 more Pods.

✅ Summary:

Pod → Smallest unit, runs containers, but no healing/scaling.

ReplicaSet → Ensures desired number of Pods, handles healing.

Deployment → Manages ReplicaSets, provides updates, scaling, and rollback.
