🏙️ Imagine Kubernetes as a big company (organization)

This company runs many projects (applications).
To manage everything smoothly, it has two main parts:

🧠 The Management Team (Control Plane)
🏭 The Workers (Worker Nodes)

### 🧠 Master Node (Control Plane):

This team doesn’t do the work itself — it just decides what should happen, monitors progress, and makes sure everything is running correctly.




---

### 💪 Worker Node
- **Kubelet**: Agent that ensures containers are running.
- **Kube Proxy**: Handles networking and load balancing.
- **Container Runtime**: Software used to run containers (e.g., containerd, Docker).
